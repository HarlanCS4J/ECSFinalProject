 Sortable Listing of Trek Episodes

This project is inspired by AceFire6's Arrowverse project (https://github.com/AceFire6/ordered-arrowverse).

The goal is to create a listing of all Star Trek media that can be sorted by:

* Trek Chronology
* Airdate Chronology

It will include:

* The Original Series
* The Animated Series
* The Next Generation
* Deep Space Nine
* Voyager
* Enterprise
* Discovery
* Picard
* Lower Decks
* Prime Universe Movies ("The Motion Picture" through "Nemesis")
* Kelvin Universe Movies ("Star Trek (2009)" through "Beyond")
* Short Trek offerings
